### Summary

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `atendidos_cad.php` endpoint of the i-educar application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `name` and `nome_social` parameters.

### Details
Vulnerable Endpoint:` atendidos_cad.php`
Parameter: `nome` ,`nome_social ` and` email`

The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `nm_instituicao` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser.

### PoC

Insert the payload `"><img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-PoC')>` in the `Name` or `nome_social` field then save:

nome:

nome_social

Register the payload in the` e-mail` field at the `atendidos_cad.php `endpoint. After that, the XSS can be triggered by opening the atendidos_det.php endpoint.
