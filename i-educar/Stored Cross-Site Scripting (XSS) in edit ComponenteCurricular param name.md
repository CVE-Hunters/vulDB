### Summary

 Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the  `ComponenteCurricular/edit`  endpoint of the I-educar application 2.10. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the name parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the page `ComponenteCurricular/view` is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk.

### Details
Vulnerable Endpoint: `ComponenteCurricular/edit `
Parameters: `name`

The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `name` parameters. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system.

### PoC
Register the payload in the `name` field at the `ComponenteCurricular/edit`endpoint.

After that, the XSS can be triggered by opening the `ComponenteCurricular/view endpoint` corresponding to the edited ID.
